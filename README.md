# AltaRica 3.0 Open Model Library

This repository provides an open collection of **AltaRica 3.0 models** released by the **Altarica Association**.  
It gathers models used in **training sessions**, **teaching materials**, and **scientific research**, made freely available to the community for learning, experimentation, reproducibility, and further development.

## 📚 About the Repository

This library includes:

- **Training models**  
  Models used in courses, tutorials, and hands-on sessions to teach the AltaRica 3.0 language, safety modelling, risk assessment, and model-based dependability analysis.

- **Research models**  
  Models developed and published in **scientific papers**, illustrating real case studies or methodological advances.

- **Reference examples**  
  Classic benchmark models and simplified systems used as demonstrations.

All models are provided as **open-access resources** for education, research, and community contributions.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a **shared, community-driven** repository of AltaRica 3.0 models  
- Support **teaching**, **training**, and **self-learning**  
- Enable **reproducible research**  
- Promote **collaboration** and **best practices** in modelling
